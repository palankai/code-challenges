# Solutions to different code challenges

I (try) not to post files which only accessible to logged-in users of the challenge site.
For instance, I don't post the `input.txt` files of the advent of code challenges,
you can get them from https://adventofcode.com/

Before you judge my code:
- I try to challenge myself with different languages which I don't know or barely use :)
- I use this as a practice playground, I try new ways of solving the puzzles
- You might have to find dependencies or requirements on your own
- I probably won't change a committed solution, and won't upgrade later
